===============================

This project implements everything that I have learned about Object-Oriented Javascript and the HTML5 Canvas. 

To play the game, please visit http://pmarkette.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/ 

To restart the game just refresh the browser.

How to play: Bug-Boy wants to go for a swim, but he has to cross the big highway to get to the water. Use the arrow keys to help him safely cross the road without getting run over by a giant beetle.
